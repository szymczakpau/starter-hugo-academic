Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.

I am a PhD student at Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics at the University of Warsaw. I work in Computational Medicine lab led by Ewa Szczurek. I am currently focusing on multi-modal single cell sequencing data using machine learning techniques.
