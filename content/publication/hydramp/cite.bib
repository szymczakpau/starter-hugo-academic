	abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) emerge as compounds that can alleviate the global health hazard of antimicrobial resistance. Since the repertoire of experimentally verified AMPs is limited, there is a need for novel computational approaches to peptide generation. For such approaches, exploring the amino-acid peptide representation space is infeasible due to its sparsity and combinatorial complexity. Thus, we propose HydrAMP, a conditional variational autoencoder that learns a lower-dimensional and continuous space of peptides{\textquoteright} representations and captures their antimicrobial properties. HydrAMP outperforms other approaches in generating peptides, either de novo, or by analogue discovery, and leverages parameter-controlled creativity. The model disentangles the latent representation of a peptide from its antimicrobial conditions, allowing for targeted generation. Wet-lab experiments and molecular dynamics simulation confirm the increased activity of a Pexiganan-based analogue produced by HydrAMP. HydrAMP proposes new promising AMP candidates, enabling progress towards a new generation of antibiotics.Competing Interest StatementOther projects in Ewa Szczurek{\textquoteright}s lab are cofunded by Merck Healthcare.},
