abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) emerge as compounds that can alleviate
  the global health hazard of antimicrobial resistance. Since the repertoire of
  experimentally verified AMPs is limited, there is a need for novel
  computational approaches to peptide generation. For such approaches, exploring
  the amino-acid peptide representation space is infeasible due to its sparsity
  and combinatorial complexity. Thus, we propose HydrAMP, a conditional
  variational autoencoder that learns a lower-dimensional and continuous space
  of peptides’ representations and captures their antimicrobial properties.
  HydrAMP outperforms other approaches in generating peptides, either de novo,
  or by analogue discovery, and leverages parameter-controlled creativity. The
  model disentangles the latent representation of a peptide from its
  antimicrobial conditions, allowing for targeted generation. Wet-lab
  experiments and molecular dynamics simulation confirm the increased activity
  of a Pexiganan-based analogue produced by HydrAMP. HydrAMP proposes new
  promising AMP candidates, enabling progress towards a new generation of
  antibiotics.
